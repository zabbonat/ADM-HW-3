## Data collection
Data were extracted from three html files: 
 * `movies1.html`
 * `movies2.html`
 * `movies3.html`

Each of these files contains 10,000 movies

## The content of the repository is

* `README.md`: a Markdown file that explains the content of our repository
* `collector.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect our data from the `html` page 
* `collector_utils.py`: a python file that stores the function we used in `collector.py`.
* `parser.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to parse the entire collection of `html` pages and save those in `tsv` files.
* `parser_utils.py`: a python file that gathers the function we used in `parser.py`.
* `index.py`: a python file that once executed generate the indexes of the Search engines.
* `index_utils.py`: a python file that contains the functions we used for creating indexes.
* `main.ipynb`: a python file that once executed build up the search engine.
* `exercise_4.py`: python file that contains the implementation of the algorithm that, given a sequence, finds the length of the longest palindromic subsequence

## Resume

We decided to adopt a group work strategy since we saw each other every day to discuss and jointly carry out the different points of the homework. The work was then carried out together by all the members of our team, sharing the previous skills of each of us.
